## Introduction

This software is an example of a **System Integration**.
This type of application interacts with DocuSign on its
own. There is no user interface and no user is present
during normal operation.

The application uses the OAuth JWT grant flow to impersonate
a user in the account.

This launcher example includes two examples:
1. Send an html, Word, and PDF file in an envelope to be signed.
1. List the envelopes in the account that are less than 30 days old.

## Installation

Requirements: PHP v5.4 or later

Download or clone this repository. Then:

````
cd eg-01-php-jwt
composer install

# Create the config file
cp ds_config_EXAMPLE.ini ds_config.ini
````

### Configure the example's settings

You can configure the example either via an .ini file or via
environment variables:

*  **ds_config.ini:** Edit the `ds_config.ini` file in the root
   directory.
   (After creating it from the `ds_config_EXAMPLE.ini` file.)
   More information for the configuration settings is below.
*  Or via **environment variables:** export the needed
   environment variables. The file `.env` lists the variables.

`ds_config.ini` is in the .gitignore file so your
private information will not be added to your repository.
Do not store your Integration Key, private key, or other
private information in your code repository.

#### Creating the Integration Key
Your DocuSign Integration Key must be configured for a JWT OAuth authentication flow:
* Create a public/private key pair for the key. Store the private key
  in a secure location. You can use a file or a key vault.
* The example requires the private key. Store the private key in the
  `ds_config.ini` file or in the environment variable
  `DS_PRIVATE_KEY`.
* If you will be using individual permission grants, you must create a
  `Redirect URI` for the key. Any URL can be used. By default, this
  example uses `https://www.docusign.com`

#### The impersonated user's guid
The JWT will impersonate a user within your account. The user can be
an individual or a user representing a group such as "HR".

The example needs the guid assigned to the user.
The guid value for each user in your account is available from
the Administration tool in the **Users** section.

To see a user's guid, **Edit** the user's information.
On the **Edit User** screen, the guid for the user is shown as
the `API Username`.

## Run the examples

````
php main.php
````
